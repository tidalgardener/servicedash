# Context Memory

## Domain/context essentials (facts only)
- ServiceDash is a local dashboard that polls public status endpoints and renders an amber-themed terminal UI.
- It also polls a few economic metrics (BTC, FX, market/commodity quotes) and keeps 24h history in SQLite.
- It includes “hypothetical” AGI/ASI clocks sourced from public forecasting sites (currently Metaculus + Manifold).

## Architecture notes (high level)
- TBD

## Conventions (naming, style, patterns)
- TBD

## Non-obvious constraints (UNCONFIRMED if needed)
- UNCONFIRMED: Exact “Gemini” status source and component mapping.
